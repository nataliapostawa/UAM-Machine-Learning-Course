# UAM Machine Learning Course

Here are the datasets and my solutions (written in Python) to Machine Learning Course set at Adam Mickiewicz Univeristy in Pozna≈Ñ. The course is based on Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning Course.

### Themes:
* NumPy Basics (01)
* Creating plots using Matplotlib (02)
* Linear Regression (03)
* Multivariate Linear Regression (04) 
* Logistics regression (05)
* Multivariate Logistics Regression (on MNIST dataset) (06)
* Optimization Methods (AdaGrad + Ensemble on MNIST) (07)
* Cross Validation (08)
* Neural Networks (09)


### Technicalities:
* Python 3
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
* Useful libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, ipywidgets

### To run IPython Notebook from command line:

    jupyter notebook
